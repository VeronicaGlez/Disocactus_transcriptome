# **Comparative transcriptomics of flower development of *Disocactus* genus (Hylocereae, Cactaceae)**
___


In this repository you will find RNA-seq data analysis and scripts of  *de novo* assambly and annotation from cacti flower development of two species *Disocactus* genus: *D. speciosus* and *D. eichlamii*.

## Disocactus background

*Disocactus* is an epiphytic cacti genus, principaly distribuited in Mexico but is also present in centralamericas. The genus is confomerd by 13 species, with constrastant flower morphology making *Disocactus* a model genus to studie flower diversification in cacti. [Phylogenetic studies made with cDNA](https://bioone.org/journals/willdenowia/volume-46/issue-1/wi.46.46112/Molecular-phylogeny-and-taxonomy-of-the-genus-iDisocactus-i-iCactaceae/10.3372/wi.46.46112.full) had shown that *Disocactus* is a monophyletic group member of [Hylocereeae tribe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication320829990_A_phylogenetic_framework_for_the_Hylocereeae_Cactaceae_and_implications_for_the_circumscription_of_the_genera) and sister to *Epiphyllum* and *Pseudorhipsalis* genus.

In this repository you will find four folders:

1. **bin**: in thise folder you will find the scripts for cleanig data, *de novo* assambly and gene annotation.
2. **data**
3. **out**
4. **meta**: you will find data of the samples. The species code follow the next order; **DE** for *D.eichlamii* and **DS** for *D.speciosus*, then the number of the developmental stage that could be 1-3, then separeted by a - is the number of colection and finally are two words PA if the tissue belongs to perianth or PC if the tissue belongs to pericarpel. For example **DE1-4PA**.
