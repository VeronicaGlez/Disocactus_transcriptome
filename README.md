## Disocactus background

*Disocactus* is an epiphytic cacti genus, principaly distribuited in Mexico but is also present in centralamericas. The genus is confomerd by 13 species, with constrast flower morphology making *Disocactus* a model to studie flower diversification in cacti flowers. [Phylogenetic studies made with cDNA](https://bioone.org/journals/willdenowia/volume-46/issue-1/wi.46.46112/Molecular-phylogeny-and-taxonomy-of-the-genus-iDisocactus-i-iCactaceae/10.3372/wi.46.46112.full) had shown that *Disocactus* is a monophyletic group member of [Hylocereeae tribe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication320829990_A_phylogenetic_framework_for_the_Hylocereeae_Cactaceae_and_implications_for_the_circumscription_of_the_genera).
